  Hello, %{custom_data1}! Let's play!

rules: |+
  Here are the rules:
  > The Goal: Get your card value total as close to %{custom_data1} as possible, without going over.
  > Card values are:
    > 2-10: face value
    > Jack, Queen, or King: 10
    > Ace: 1 or 11 depending on card value total (11 if total doesn't exceed %{custom_data1}, otherwise 1)
  > Gameplay:
    1. YOU and the DEALER will each be dealt 2 cards from a shuffled 52-card deck.
    2. YOU will go first. At each turn, you may choose to 'hit' or 'stay'. 
    3. If YOU 'hit', another card from the deck will be drawn, and you will again be asked to 'hit' or 'stay'.
    4. YOU may continue to 'hit' until you either 'bust' or choose to 'stay'.
    5. If YOU 'bust' (i.e. card value total exceeds %{custom_data1}), the DEALER wins the round
    6. If YOU choose to 'stay' before busting, it will be the DEALER'S turn.
    7. If the DEALER 'busts', YOU win the round
    8. If the DEALER 'stays' before busting, the player with the higher card value total wins the round.
  > The first to win %{custom_data2} rounds will be the grand winner!
